Public Transport
----------------

The University of Washington is situated about 5 miles North of downtown
Seattle.

**Light Rail**

Seattle is served by the `Link Light Rail <https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules>`_.
The nearest station to Kane Hall is the University of Washington
Station at the northern end of the line. NB: Don't get confused with
the similarly named University Street Station, which is downtown!

Our venue is about a 10 minute walk from the Light Rail station, over a
pedestrian bridge and slightly uphill through campus.

There are trains running every 10 minutes, and the line starts south of
SeaTac airport. It takes about 70 minutes to get from the airport to the venue.

Tickets can be bought at the station (either one-way, or returns) at
automated kiosks. You can also purchase Orca Cards, which let you tap-on and
tap-off to pay as you go.

**Buses**

There are regular bus services run by King County Metro to the University
district. There is a stop on campus, and many other buses stop on Campus
Parkway which is a 5 minute walk away.

The timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.


Ride Shares & Taxis
-------------------

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft, Uber and
ReachNow. There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but
there may not be much public street parking near the University.


Driving
-------

The University is accessible from the I-5, at the 45th St exit. There is some
parking on campus [to be confirmed]. Prices / availablity TBD.
